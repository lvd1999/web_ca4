# Welcome to Ammu-Nation

AMMU-Nation features more than 7,000 guns in stock on any given day making us the largest gun shop in the United States. After opening its doors in 1959, we've been in the same location in Charlotte, NC and we remain a family business to this day with three generations of the Lee family working here daily. Why does this matter to you? Unlike the big-box stores, the Lee family has shared its experience, know how and customer-first attitude that comes with their 50-plus years of being in business. We also have a full-service gun repair facility on site and we're proud to say that we can service what we sell.
